# DC-Motor-Controller-Simulator
This project demonstrates the design and comparison of intelligent controllers for a DC motor system. It integrates Fuzzy Logic, Neuro-Fuzzy models, and PID control to simulate and optimise motor speed under load disturbances. It also features a full GUI interface for experimentation and performance analysis.
