# DC-Motor-Controller-Simulator
This project demonstrates the design and comparison of intelligent controllers for a DC motor system. It integrates Fuzzy Logic, Neuro-Fuzzy models, and PID control to simulate and optimise motor speed under load disturbances. It also features a full GUI interface for experimentation and performance analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Simulate a DC motor system using classical and intelligent control strategies
- Evaluate controller performance (MSE, tracking behaviour)
- Provide GUI-based simulation tools
- Apply Genetic Algorithm (GA) to auto-tune PID gains
- Use real step response data for fuzzy/neuro models
